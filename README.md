# riscv-hw-trojans
Hardware Trojans implemented for RISC-V designs.

## HOST 2024
The repo will be updated soon (before the end of May) with the Interrupt-Resilient Trojan designs and their supporting software.
The IRTs have been tested against the [CVA6](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6) RISC-V micro-architecture.
